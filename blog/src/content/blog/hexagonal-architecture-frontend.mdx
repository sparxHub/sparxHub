Modern backend systems need to be **scalable, maintainable, and adaptable**. Whether handling **payments, user authentication, or database access**, a well-structured architecture **separates business logic from infrastructure**, making the system **flexible** and **easy to evolve**.

One of the best approaches to achieve this is **Hexagonal Architecture**, also known as **Ports and Adapters**.

<BlockBold>
  Hexagonal Architecture ensures that your core business logic is independent of databases, APIs, or
  external services, making your system future-proof.

## 🚀 The Problem: Rigid and Fragile Backend Systems

Imagine a backend system that processes **payments**. Initially, it only supports **Stripe**. Over time, new requirements emerge:

- A client requests **PayPal** integration.
- A different region requires **local bank payments**.
- Future expansion demands **Apple Pay or cryptocurrency** support.

If the system is **tightly coupled** to Stripe, these changes require **major refactoring**, increasing costs and complexity.

This problem isn't limited to payments—it happens with **databases**, **messaging systems**, and **third-party APIs**.

## 🛠️ What is Hexagonal Architecture?

Hexagonal Architecture **decouples business logic** from external dependencies using **Ports and Adapters**.

### 🏗️ The Key Components:

1️⃣ **Core Domain (Business Logic)** – The heart of the application.  
2️⃣ **Ports (Interfaces)** – Define how external services interact with the core.  
3️⃣ **Adapters (Implementations)** – Handle actual integration with external services.

Think of **a power outlet** (port) that accepts **different chargers** (adapters) without changing the electrical system (core).

---

## 🎯 Applying Hexagonal Architecture (Using Payments as an Example)

Let’s see how Hexagonal Architecture applies in a **backend system** with **payments as an example**.

### 1️⃣ Business Logic Stays Independent

The **core domain** doesn't care **how** a payment is processed. It only defines **what** a payment provider must do.

```ts title="ports/PaymentProvider.ts"
export interface PaymentProvider {
  charge(amount: number, currency: string): Promise<string>
}
```

This is a **Port**—it defines a contract for any **payment provider**.

---

### 2️⃣ External Services are Plugged in Using Adapters

Each **adapter** implements the `PaymentProvider` interface.

#### ✅ Stripe Adapter:

```ts title="adapters/StripeAdapter.ts"
import { PaymentProvider } from '../ports/PaymentProvider'

export class StripeAdapter implements PaymentProvider {
  async charge(amount: number, currency: string): Promise<string> {
    return `Charged $${amount} ${currency} via Stripe`
  }
}
```

#### ✅ PayPal Adapter:

```ts title="adapters/PayPalAdapter.ts"
import { PaymentProvider } from '../ports/PaymentProvider'

export class PayPalAdapter implements PaymentProvider {
  async charge(amount: number, currency: string): Promise<string> {
    return `Charged $${amount} ${currency} via PayPal`
  }
}
```

These **Adapters** handle communication with external services, keeping **the core system untouched**.

---

### 3️⃣ The Service Layer Bridges Everything

The **business logic** only interacts with the `PaymentProvider` interface.

```ts title="services/PaymentService.ts"
import { PaymentProvider } from '../ports/PaymentProvider'

export class PaymentService {
  constructor(private provider: PaymentProvider) {}

  async processPayment(amount: number, currency: string) {
    return this.provider.charge(amount, currency)
  }
}
```

**Notice:** The `PaymentService` doesn’t care which provider is used—it just calls `charge()`.

<BlockBold>
  This is the core idea of Hexagonal Architecture: The business logic stays **clean**, while
  external dependencies are handled separately.
</BlockBold>

---

### 4️⃣ The API Simply Selects the Payment Provider

The **API layer** picks the correct **adapter** dynamically.

```ts title="controllers/PaymentController.ts"
import { Request, Response } from 'express'
import { PaymentService } from '../services/PaymentService'
import { StripeAdapter } from '../adapters/StripeAdapter'
import { PayPalAdapter } from '../adapters/PayPalAdapter'

export class PaymentController {
  static async pay(req: Request, res: Response) {
    const { amount, currency, provider } = req.body
    const paymentProvider = provider === 'paypal' ? new PayPalAdapter() : new StripeAdapter()

    const paymentService = new PaymentService(paymentProvider)
    const result = await paymentService.processPayment(amount, currency)

    res.json({ message: result })
  }
}
```

This means **new payment providers** can be added **without touching the business logic**.

---

## 🔄 Beyond Payments: Other Use Cases

Hexagonal Architecture is **not just for payments**—it applies to **any backend system** that interacts with external dependencies.

### 🔹 Database Access

- Instead of hardcoding **MongoDB**, use a **Repository Pattern** to switch to **PostgreSQL** or **DynamoDB** easily.

### 🔹 Messaging & Event Streaming

- Define a **MessageQueuePort** so you can swap **Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS SQS** seamlessly.

### 🔹 Authentication

- Implement an **AuthProviderPort** to support **JWT, OAuth, Firebase, or custom authentication** without modifying business logic.

<BlockBold>
  Hexagonal Architecture applies to **any system that interacts with external services**, making
  backend applications flexible and future-proof.
</BlockBold>

## 🧪 Testing with Mock Adapters

Hexagonal Architecture also makes **unit testing** easier. Instead of calling **real payment APIs**, we inject **mock adapters**.

```ts title="tests/PaymentService.test.ts"
import { PaymentService } from '../services/PaymentService'
import { PaymentProvider } from '../ports/PaymentProvider'

class MockPaymentProvider implements PaymentProvider {
  async charge(amount: number, currency: string) {
    return `Test payment of $${amount} ${currency}`
  }
}

describe('PaymentService', () => {
  it('should process payments using a mock provider', async () => {
    const service = new PaymentService(new MockPaymentProvider())
    const result = await service.processPayment(50, 'USD')

    expect(result).toBe('Test payment of $50 USD')
  })
})
```

**Benefit?**  
✅ No real API calls during tests.  
✅ Faster, more reliable unit testing.  
✅ Ensures business logic is tested **independently** of external services.

## 🚀 The Benefits of Hexagonal Architecture

By structuring our **backend system** with Hexagonal Architecture, we gain:

✅ **Scalability** – Easily switch databases, APIs, or third-party services.  
✅ **Maintainability** – Business logic stays **clean and testable**.  
✅ **Vendor Independence** – Swap Stripe for PayPal without major changes.  
✅ **Better Testing** – Use **mock adapters** for unit tests.

<BlockBold>
  Whether it's a **payment system, database, or event-driven architecture**, Hexagonal Architecture
  makes backends **future-proof**.
</BlockBold>

## 🔥 Conclusion

Hexagonal Architecture is a **powerful pattern** that keeps backend systems **flexible, maintainable, and testable**.

We demonstrated this **using payments as an example**, but the same principles **apply to databases, messaging queues, authentication, and any external service**.

Next time you build a backend system, **consider Hexagonal Architecture**—your future self will thank you! 🚀
