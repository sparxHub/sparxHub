Hexagonal architecture is a design pattern that enforces **separation of concerns**, ensuring that the **business logic** (domain) remains **independent of external systems**. By using **ports and adapters**, applications can interact with external dependencies in a structured manner, increasing maintainability and testability.

This approach is not limited to backend developmentâ€”**frontend applications** also benefit significantly, especially in cases where multiple data sources exist. This article walks through a **real-world use case** where **hexagonal architecture**, **repository patterns**, and **dependency injection** helped solve maintainability issues in a frontend system.

## Understanding Hexagonal Architecture in the Frontend

### Ports and Adapters: The Core Concept

At the heart of **hexagonal architecture** lies the **separation between core business logic and external concerns**:

- **Ports:** Interfaces that define how external components should interact with the core.
- **Adapters:** Implementations of these interfaces that connect the core to various external systems.

<BlockBold>
  The key idea is that the **core remains agnostic** to external implementations, enabling easy
  replacement or modification of adapters without affecting the business logic.
</BlockBold>

### A Real-World Case: The Initial Context

A company developed a **single-page web application (SPA)** used by multiple clients (tenants). This frontend **relied on a backend API** to fetch menu data, structured as follows:

```json title="Legacy Backend Response"
{
  "title": "Main Menu",
  "id": "main",
  "is_staff": false,
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Home",
      "url": "/",
      "is_staff": false
    },
    {
      "title": "Dashboards",
      "id": "dashboards",
      "items": [
        {
          "title": "Config ðŸš«",
          "url": "/dashboards-config",
          "is_staff": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Issues with the Initial Architecture

1. **Tightly Coupled Data Structures**

   - The frontend was **directly dependent on backend data structures**.
   - Any changes in the backend **required modifications in multiple places** in the frontend.

2. **Redundant Business Logic in the UI**

   - The frontend **added logic to determine staff-only items** by checking `is_staff` and modifying UI elements accordingly.
   - Business rules should reside **in the domain**, not in the UI.

3. **Visual Elements Defined by the Backend**
   - The backend **dictated UI-specific concerns**, such as which icons to display.
   - This violated **separation of concerns** since UI decisions should belong **exclusively to the frontend**.

## The Challenge: A New Backend with a Different Structure

The company introduced **a new backend (v2)** that offered **the same menu functionality** but used a **completely different response structure**:

```json title="New Backend Response (v2)"
[
  {
    "menuId": 12,
    "menuName": "Dashboards",
    "menuItemId": 9,
    "menuItemTitle": "Config",
    "menuItemStateId": 1,
    "menuItemLink": "/dashboards-config"
  }
]
```

### The Complexity of Supporting Two Backends

- **The new backend wasnâ€™t retro-compatible**.
- Some clients would continue using the **legacy backend**, while others migrated to **v2**.
- Maintaining **separate frontend implementations for each backend** would lead to **code duplication and increased maintenance costs**.

## The Solution: Decoupling the Frontend from Backend-Specific Data

### Step 1: Define a Unified Domain Model

Instead of tying frontend components to **backend-specific structures**, a **domain model** was introduced:

```ts title="Menu Entities"
type State = 'disabled' | 'only_for_staff' | 'open'

class Menu {
  constructor(values: MenuDto) {
    this.id = values.id
    this.title = values.title
    this.state = values.state
    this.children = values.children
  }

  get onlyForStaff(): boolean {
    return this.state === 'only_for_staff'
  }
}

class MenuItem {
  constructor(values: MenuItemDto) {
    this.id = values.id
    this.title = values.title
    this.url = values.url
    this.state = values.state
  }

  get isExternal(): boolean {
    return this.url.includes('http')
  }
}
```

<BlockBold>
  By **modeling the menu as a domain entity**, the frontend can remain **agnostic** to backend
  response structures.
</BlockBold>

### Step 2: Introduce a Port for Data Fetching

To enforce **separation of concerns**, a **repository interface (port)** was defined:

```ts title="Port Definition"
interface MenuRepo {
  getMainMenu(states: State[]): Promise<(MenuItem | Menu)[]>
}
```

### Step 3: Implement Adapters for Each Backend

Each backend now had **its own adapter**, responsible for **transforming backend-specific responses into domain models**.

#### Legacy Backend Adapter

```ts title="Legacy Backend Adapter"
class LegacyMenuRepo implements MenuRepo {
  async getMainMenu(states: State[]): Promise<(MenuItem | Menu)[]> {
    const response = await fetch('tenant.company.com/get_menu')
    const backendMenu = await response.json()

    return backendMenu.items.map((item) => this.responseToEntity(item))
  }

  private responseToEntity(data: any): Menu | MenuItem {
    return new MenuItem({ id: data.id, title: data.title, url: data.url })
  }
}
```

#### New Backend (v2) Adapter

```ts title="New Backend Adapter"
const stateMappings: Record<number, State> = {
  1: 'only_for_staff',
  2: 'open',
}

class V2MenuRepo implements MenuRepo {
  async getMainMenu(states: State[]): Promise<(MenuItem | Menu)[]> {
    const response = await fetch('menu.company.com/company/get', {
      params: { menuItemStateId: states.map((state) => stateMappings[state]) },
    })
    const backendMenu = await response.json()

    return backendMenu.map((item) => this.responseToEntity(item))
  }

  private responseToEntity(data: any): MenuItem {
    return new MenuItem({
      id: data.menuItemId,
      title: data.menuItemTitle,
      url: data.menuItemLink,
      state: stateMappings[data.menuItemStateId],
    })
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Dependency Injection for Backend Selection

Instead of **hardcoding backend implementations**, **dependency injection** was used to determine which adapter should be used dynamically:

```ts title="Dependency Injection for Repositories"
function createMenuRepo(clientId: string): MenuRepo {
  return ['client123', 'client34'].includes(clientId) ? new V2MenuRepo() : new LegacyMenuRepo()
}

const menuRepo = createMenuRepo('client123')
menuRepo.getMainMenu(['open', 'only_for_staff'])
```

## Summary: The Power of Hexagonal Architecture in the Frontend

By applying **hexagonal architecture, dependency injection, and the repository pattern**, the frontend was successfully decoupled from backend-specific structures. The benefits included:

âœ… **No need to modify UI logic when backend structures change.**
âœ… **A unified interface for fetching menu data, regardless of backend differences.**
âœ… **Easier testing and maintainability with isolated adapters.**
âœ… **Future flexibility: Additional backends can be supported with new adapters.**

<BlockBold>
  This approach enabled a **smooth transition between multiple backends** without modifying the core
  frontend components.
</BlockBold>

By designing frontend applications with **separation of concerns in mind**, teams can achieve **greater maintainability, flexibility, and long-term scalability**.
